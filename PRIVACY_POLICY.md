**Last Updated: February 8, 2026**

This Privacy Policy describes how Jibify ("we", "us", or "our") collects, uses, and discloses your information when you use our mobile application (the "App").

## 1. Information We Collect

### A. Personal & Financial Data (Stored Locally)
Jibify is designed to be a privacy-first application. The following data is collected and stored **locally** on your device:
- **Transaction Data**: Expenses, income, categories, and budgets you enter.
- **Profile Information**: The name you set within the app.
- **Savings Goals**: Targets and progress for your saving goals.

**We do not transmit your financial transactions or personal profile data to any external server.** Your financial data resides solely on your device (and any personal backups you manually export).

### B. Usage & Diagnostics (Third Party Services)
We use third-party services to improve the stability and performance of the App. 

**Google Analytics for Firebase**
We use Google Analytics for Firebase to collect information about how you use our App. This usage data may include information such as your device's Internet Protocol address (e.g. IP address), browser type, browser version, the pages of our Service that you visit, the time and date of your visit, the time spent on those pages, unique device identifiers and other diagnostic data. We use this information to analyze usage patterns and improve the App.

These services may collect:
- **Device Information**: Model, OS version, and unique device identifiers.
- **Crash Logs**: Information about app crashes to help us fix bugs (via Firebase Crashlytics).
- **Usage Data**: Anonymous interaction data to understand how features are used.

### C. Advertising (AdMob)
We use Google AdMob to serve advertisements in the app. AdMob may collect:
- **Advertising ID**: To serve personalized ads
- **Device Information**: Model, OS version, and screen size
- **Ad Interaction Data**: Clicks, views, and conversions

AdMob uses this data in accordance with [Google's Privacy Policy](https://policies.google.com/privacy).

You can opt out of personalized advertising by adjusting your device settings (Settings > Google > Ads > Opt out of Ads Personalization).

### D. Biometric Data (Optional)
If you enable biometric authentication (fingerprint/face unlock):
- Biometric data is processed **locally** on your device only
- We do NOT collect, store, or transmit your biometric data to any server
- Biometric authentication uses your device's secure hardware

## 2. How We Use Your Information
- To provide the core functionality of tracking your personal finances.
- To detect and fix technical issues (crashes and bugs).
- To improve the user experience based on anonymous usage patterns.
- To serve relevant advertisements through AdMob.

## 3. Data Sharing
We share limited data with the following third parties:
- **Google Firebase**: Analytics and crash reporting
- **Google AdMob**: Advertising services

**We do NOT sell your personal information to third parties.**
Your financial transaction data remains local and is **NEVER** shared with any third party.

## 4. Data Retention
- **Local Data**: Retained on your device until you uninstall the App or clear its data.
- **Analytics Data**: Retained in accordance with Firebase's data retention policies.
- **Advertising Data**: Retained in accordance with AdMob's data retention policies.

## 4.1 Google Play Data Safety
In accordance with Google Play's Data Safety requirements, we disclose the following about data collected by Jibify:
- **Financial Information & Personal Data:** We **do not** collect, transmit, or share your financial data, budgets, transaction history, or personal profile names. This data is strictly local.
- **Diagnostics & Crash Logs:** We collect crash logs and diagnostic data via Firebase Crashlytics to improve app stability. This data is **collected** and is **required** for the app to function properly.
- **Device & Other IDs:** We collect and share device identifiers via Google AdMob and Firebase Analytics to serve personalized advertisements and track anonymous usage.
- **Data Deletion:** Because all user-generated financial/personal data remains locally on your device, deleting the app will permanently delete this data. We do not have servers storing your data, thus we cannot provide a mechanism to delete data on our end.

## 5. Security
We value your trust in providing us your Personal Information, thus we are striving to use commercially acceptable means of protecting it.
- **App Lock**: Jibify offers Biometric and Password locks to prevent unauthorized local access to your app.
- **No Cloud Sync**: Since we do not sync your financial data to a cloud server, your data is as secure as your physical device.
- **Encryption**: All network communications with third-party services use HTTPS encryption.

## 6. Children's Privacy
These Services do not address anyone under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under 13.
